# GeoPins description

A live geolocation application where users can use a map to pin different locations and to then share content such as pictures, location and reviews.

This is a full stack React application made entirely from scratch for the purposes of learning GraphQL and to practice interacting with a map API called Mapbox and ReactMapGL. Also brushing up on the use of MongoDB.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/Nimzyow/GeoPins.git`  
run `npm install` in GeoPins folder  
change to client folder and run `npm install` again.
